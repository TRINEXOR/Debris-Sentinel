# Debris Sentinel - Space Debris Collision Risk Prediction

> Space debris has become a major concern for satellite operations and space missions. With thousands of objects orbiting Earth, the probability of collision is increasing significantly.
This project aims to develop an intelligent system that predicts potential collision risks between space debris and active satellites using orbital data and machine learning techniques.

## Live Demo

**https://space-debris-collision-risk-production.up.railway.app**

Search for any satellite (e.g. ISS, Hubble, Starlink), click it on the interactive 3D globe, and get AI-powered collision risk analysis against 17,000+ tracked objects in real time.

---

## How It Works

This system intelligently predicts potential collisions between active satellites and space debris by combining orbital physics with advanced AI techniques.

It analyzes data from over 17,000 tracked space objects using TLE datasets from CelesTrak. Using SGP4 orbital propagation, it simulates the movement of these objects over a 7-day period to identify possible close approaches.

A powerful deep learning model (transformer-based) is used to evaluate collision risks by learning from past conjunction events. The system also applies Evidential Deep Learning to estimate uncertainty, ensuring more reliable and trustworthy predictions.

To enhance understanding, the results are visualized through an interactive 3D globe, allowing users to explore satellite positions and potential risks in real time.

## Model Checkpoints

Pre-trained weights (~290MB) are hosted on HuggingFace and downloaded automatically:

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `best_model.pth` | 57MB | Primary model (required) |
| `ckpt_ep039_auc0.9999.pth` | 57MB | Ensemble checkpoint |
| `ckpt_ep041_auc0.9999.pth` | 57MB | Ensemble checkpoint |

## Deployment

### Railway (Current Production)

The app is deployed as a single Docker container on Railway, serving both the FastAPI backend and React frontend.

```toml
# railway.toml
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"

[deploy]
startCommand = "sh -c 'python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}'"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 600
```

To deploy your own instance:

1. Fork this repository
2. Upload model weights to HuggingFace (see `download_models.py`)
3. Connect the repo on [railway.app](https://railway.app)
4. Railway auto-builds and deploys from the Dockerfile

### Docker (Self-hosted)

```bash
docker build -t debris-sentinel .
docker run -p 8000:8000 debris-sentinel
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| ML Framework | PyTorch 2.1+ |
| Backend | FastAPI + Uvicorn |
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite |
| 3D Globe | react-globe.gl + Three.js |

## Known Limitations

1. **Static TLE data** -- uses daily snapshots, not real-time feeds
2. **7-day prediction window** -- beyond this, TLE propagation error grows significantly
3. **Simplified physics** -- does not model maneuvers, atmospheric drag variations, or solar radiation pressure
4. **Cloud CPU inference** -- predictions take ~70s on Railway's shared CPU; <5s with GPU
5. **Label approximation** -- ground truth derived from physics-based thresholds, not verified collision records

---

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Real-time TLE updates via Space-Track.org API
- [ ] Multi-satellite conjunction analysis
- [ ] Maneuver recommendation engine with delta-v optimization
- [ ] Historical trend analysis and conjunction frequency tracking
- [ ] GPU-accelerated inference tier
- [x] Docker containerization
- [x] Cloud deployment (Railway)
- [x] Interactive 3D satellite visualization
